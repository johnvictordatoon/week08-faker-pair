# Generating Fake Data Using Faker (Week 8)

Faker is a library in PHP that can generate fake sample data.
***

## Requirements
- `Composer` - required to install Faker.
- `PHP or XAMPP (Latest Version)` - required for the database.

## Installation
1. In **Command Prompt**, Run the command `composer req fzaninotto/faker` in your current folder to install Faker.
2. Start running the files. 
3. And **that's it**!

## Notes
- You can run the PHP files inside `3 items` folder locally, as long as PHP is on path.
- Use `XAMMP` (recommended) to run the PHP files inside `faker with db` folder. 
    - To run this, use the **`index.php`** and include the **`conn.php`** (database connection).
